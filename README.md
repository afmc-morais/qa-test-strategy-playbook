A senior-level example of a practical, scalable, and risk-oriented QA strategy used in modern Agile and CI/CD environments.

This repository demonstrates how quality can be embedded across the entire software lifecycle — not as a final validation phase, but as a continuous engineering discipline.

## About

I approach Quality Engineering as a strategic function that reduces production risks, increases deployment confidence, and supports scalable growth.

This project reflects:

- Risk-Based Testing strategy
- CI/CD quality gates
- API & UI validation structure
- Release decision framework
- Measurable quality signals
- Clear communication with stakeholders

---

## Key Concepts

- Quality Engineering vs Traditional QA
- Risk-Based Prioritization
- Automation as Deployment Confidence
- CI/CD as Quality Enabler
- Metrics-Driven Decisions
- Preventive vs Reactive Quality

## How I Work

I believe senior QA is defined by influence, not only execution.

My workflow focuses on:

- Anticipating risks before implementation
- Challenging unclear requirements early
- Designing test strategies aligned with business impact
- Defining measurable quality signals
- Automating what protects the business, not everything
- Reducing flakiness and maintaining automation health
- Acting decisively during release risks and incidents

Quality is not about finding bugs.
It is about preventing incidents.

## Quality Gates in CI/CD

A release should only move forward when objective signals confirm stability.

Example Quality Gates:

- Smoke suite must pass (CI trigger)
- Critical APIs contract validation must pass
- High-risk regression coverage executed
- No open critical defects
- Automation pass rate above defined threshold
- Flakiness rate below acceptable tolerance
- Performance baseline within expected limits

Deployment is a decision supported by evidence.
